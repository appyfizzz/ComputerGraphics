Don't call display() explicitly
    use glutPostRedisplay() to request it
Never call sleep(), as program locks up
    glutTimerFunc() can be used to call function after a set time
    use while loop possibly

GL_LINES different from GL_LINE
GL_LINE_STRIP used to connect a set of points
    GL_LINE_LOOP reconnects to first point

GL_TRIANGLES

displaying a scene
    register using glutDisplayFunc()
    glClear()
    draw something
    glFlush() // tell OpenGL you are done
    glutSwapBuffers()
    schedule using glutPostRedisplay(), not display()

glTranslate[fd](dx, dy, dz); f(loat) or d(ouble)
    applies transformation to all dimensions
glScale[fd](Sx, Sy, Sz)
    multiplies by a factor 
glRotate[fd](angle, Ux, Uy, Uz)
    angle in degrees, not radians
glPushMatrix() saves state of transformation matrix at that time
    glPopMatrix() resets to what it was when you did the push

to rotate about another point, move object to origin, rotate, move back

Projections
    Orthographic: same size regardless of distance
	glOrtho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)
	easiest
    Perspective
	glFrustrum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far)
	GLU convenience functions
	    gluPerspective(fov, aspect, Znear, Zfar)
	    gluLookAt(Ex, Ey, Ez, Cx, Cy, Cz, Ux, Uy, Uz)

Dimensions
OpenGL only deals with cartesian coordinates
    can use math to modify cartesian by polar
