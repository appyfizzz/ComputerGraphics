# Game: Final Project

## Gameplay

- Setting is in mysterious cave
- Objective is to retrieve stolen treasure and return to cave entrance
- Left-click to interact with select objects (lantern, key, treasure chest)

## Points of Interest

- Stalactites/stalagmites lose detail (# vertices) as distance from user increases
- Collect key, randomly placed in one of 4 preconfigured locations within cave
- Having key lets you open treasure chest, in one of remaining 3 locations
- Taking treasure from opened chest triggers alarm
- Triggered alarm causes flashing light and cave to collapse, requiring a dash to the cave entrance to survive
- Entire cave rumbles when near total collapse

## Cheats

- Run program with additional command to activate cheats:
- `./game godMode` grants you the ability to fly and walk through walls. You can see the key and treasure easily from here!
- `./game escapeMode` will place you at treasure chest with alarm started and you will have to escape!
