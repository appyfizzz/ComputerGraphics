Game in cave with objective of opening treasure chest and retrieving object before returning to origin. Click to interact with select objects

State of project:
- Cave layout complete
- First person navigation working
- Mouse movement to be refined
- Game objectives implemented successfully
- Lacking object collision avoidance (please do not walk through walls)
- Lacking cave collapse causing game over
- Still commented-out code in project

Future aims
- Add God mode
- Add sound
- Bind 'a' and 'd' to strafing
- Add chest opening and key turning animation
