hw3: Lighting and Textures

Andrew Gaines
CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2016

Draw cave with randomly generated stalagtites and stalagmites and a mysterious chest with textures. Light cycles through cave, illuminating structures.
Some intuition and code borrowed from [lighthouse3D](http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glut-tutorial/keyboard-example-moving-around-the-world/) as well as CSCIX229 examples.
